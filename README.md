# Algorithmic problem solving

Collection os excerises and labs solved in algorithmic at Liu (course code tddd95).

Most of these problems can be found at <https://open.kattis.com/>, but some only exists on Liu's private version of theplatform.

If you're looking to plagiarise; don't. Nothing here is very hard to learn. In fact, 99% of it can be found at <https://cp-algorithms.com/>.

## Structure & Docs

There is no real structure and documentation varies. All lab solutions include some theory in a comment at the top and should be well documented. Exercises, on ther other hand, vary. Don't get your hopes up.
